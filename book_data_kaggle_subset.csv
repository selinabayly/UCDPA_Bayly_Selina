Terry Pratchett,"The Barnes & Noble ReviewWith the debut of his first young-adult novel, science fiction writer Terry Pratchett invites readers ages 12 and up to visit Discworld -- an imaginary land well known to Pratchett's adult following. At the heart of this tale is a slightly twisted take on the old Pied Piper theme, a talking, thinking cat named Maurice, and a supporting cast of equally talented rats who bear such comical names as Big Savings, Nourishing, and Dangerous Beans. Maurice and the rats have teamed up with a young lad named Keith to implement a clever moneymaking scheme. Upon entering a town, the rats make a general nuisance of themselves -- stealing food and widdling on things -- until the townsfolk become desperate to get rid of them. Then Maurice and Keith appear on the scene and offer to save the day by ridding the town of its infestation for a small fee. It seems like a surefire plan until the group arrives in the town of Bad Blintz and gets hooked up with Malicia, a young girl with a vivid imagination and a knack for finding trouble. When it's discovered that Bad Blintz already has a rat problem -- one that a couple of shifty-eyed rat catchers claim to have under control -- things turn deadly. For lurking beneath the town's streets is an obstacle course of mangling rattraps and noxious poisons. And beyond that is a monster so powerful and ugly, even Malicia couldn't imagine it. As Maurice and the rats battle for their very survival, a number of provocative themes surface: life after death, good versus evil, and the sacrifice of the few for the many. But be forewarned -- those in search of lighter fare in these troubled times may not find what they are looking for in Pratchett's vision Despite plenty of razor-sharp wit and lighthearted moments, this tale has an underbelly as dark as the tunnels beneath Bad Blintz. Though The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents is deeply witty and engaging, some readers may find parts of the story -- descriptions of how some of the rats die and how others eat their dead -- rather intense.

Roy  Lewis|Terry Pratchett|Carlo Brera,"Â«Il libro che avete fra le mani Ã¨ uno dei piÃ¹ divertenti degli ultimi cinquecentomila anniÂ» ha scritto Terry Pratchett.

Un curioso gruppetto, che si trovÃ², sotto la guida del grande Edward, nella delicata situazione di chi dÃ  allâ€™evoluzione una spinta che non si riequilibrerÃ  mai: la spinta da cui siamo nati tutti noi. Ragionando con impeccabile acume scientifico, nonchÃ© un delizioso humour freddo, Edward e i suoi scoprirono Â«alcune delle cose piÃ¹ potenti e spaventose su cui la razza umana abbia mai messo le mani: il fuoco, la lancia, il matrimonio e cosÃ¬ viaÂ», sempre sulla base di una elementare esigenza: quella di Â«cucinare senza essere cucinati e mangiare senza essere mangiatiÂ». E naturalmente non mancarono le dispute e i crucci, perchÃ© ogni volta si poteva discutere se quelle nuove invenzioni erano davvero buone o cattive, se non rischiavano di sfuggire al controllo e soprattutto se non andavano un poâ€™ troppo contro la natura. Mah...Pubblicato per la prima volta nel 1960, e poi ripreso piÃ¹ volte sotto vari titoli, questo libro si Ã¨ fatto strada silenziosamente fra i classici della fantascienza a ritroso. Ma in realtÃ  Ã¨ un libro inclassificabile: una riflessione romanzesca, acutissima e leggera, su tutta la storia dellâ€™umanitÃ , contrassegnata in ogni dettaglio da quella limpidezza e da quellâ€™ironia che appartengono alla migliore tradizione letteraria e scientifica inglese.

You shouldn't treat people like they was characters, like they was things. But if you do, then you've got to know where the story ends.'It seemed an easy job... After all, how difficult could it be to make sure that a servant girl doesn't marry a prince? Quite hard, actually, even for the witches Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick. That's the problem with real life â€“ it tends to get in the way of a good story, and a good story is hard to resist. Servant girls have to marry the prince. That's what life is all about. You can't fight a Happy Ending, especially when it comes with glass slippers and a Fairy Godmother who has made Destiny an offer it can't refuse.At least - up until now...",,Paperback,9.78E+12,288 pages,4.22,61556,1581,Witches Abroad,Fantasy|Fiction|Humor,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1331292982l/833427.jpg
Terry Pratchett,"'What shall we do?' said Twoflower.'Panic?' said Rincewind hopefully. He always held that panic was the best means of survival.As it moves towards a seemingly inevitable collision with a malevolent red star, the Discworld could do with a hero. What it doesnâ€™t need is a singularly inept and cowardly wizard, still recovering from the trauma of falling off the edge of the world, or a well-meaning tourist and his luggage which has a mind (and legs) of its own.

Terry Pratchett|Neil Gaiman," According to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch (the world's only completely accurate book of prophecies, written in 1655, before she exploded), the world will end on a Saturday. Next Saturday, in fact. Just before dinner.   So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing, Atlantis is rising, frogs are falling, tempers are flaring. Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demonâ€”both of whom have lived amongst Earth's mortals since The Beginning and have grown rather fond of the lifestyleâ€”are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture.  And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist . . .

All he wants is the usual three wishes: to be immortal, rule the world and have the most beautiful woman fall madly in love with him. The usual stuff. But what he gets is Rincewind, and Rincewind's Luggage into the bargain.

Terry Pratchett|Jacqueline Simpson,"Terry Pratchett joins up with a leading folklorist to reveal the legends, myths and customs of Discworld, together with helpful hints from Planet Earth.Most of us grew up having always known when to touch wood or cross our fingers, and what happens when a princess kisses a frog or a boy pulls a sword from a stone, yet sadly some of these things are beginning to be forgotten. Legends, myths, and fairy tales: our world is made up of the stories we told ourselves about where we came from and how we got here. It is the same on Discworld, except that beings, which on Earth are creatures of the imagination â€” like vampires, trolls, witches and, possibly, gods â€” are real, alive and, in some cases kicking, on the Disc.In The Folklore of Discworld, Terry Pratchett teams up with leading British folklorist Jacqueline Simpson to take an irreverent yet illuminating look at the living myths and folklore that are reflected, celebrated and affectionately libelled in the uniquely imaginative universe of Discworld.",,Hardcover,9.78E+12,372 pages,3.95,2416,181,The Folklore of Discworld,Fantasy|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320399449l/2429032.jpg
Terry Pratchett,"In the beginning there wasâ€¦a turtle.Somewhere on the frontier between thought and reality exists the Discworld, a parallel time and place which might sound and smell very much like our own, but which looks completely different. Particularly as itâ€™s carried though space on the back of a giant turtle (sex unknown). It plays by different rules.But then, some things are the same everywhere. The Discâ€™s very existence is about to be threatened by a strange new blight: the worldâ€™s first tourist, upon whose survival rests the peace and prosperity of the land. Unfortunately, the person charged with maintaining that survival in the face of robbers, mercenaries and, well, Death, is a spectacularly inept wizardâ€¦",,Paperback,9.78E+12,288 pages,3.99,259203,7595,The Colour Of Magic,Fantasy|Fiction|Humor,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344371537l/13153953.jpg
Terry Pratchett|Ian Stewart|Jack Cohen,"Roundworld is in trouble again, and this time it looks fatal. Having created it in the first place, the wizards of Unseen University feel vaguely responsible for its safety. They know the creatures who lived there escaped the impending Big Freeze by inventing the space elevator -- they even intervened to rid the planet of a plague of elves, who attempted to divert humanity onto a different time track. But now it's all gone wrong -- Victorian England has stagnated and the pace of progress would embarrass a limping snail. Unless something drastic is done, there won't be time for anyone to invent spaceflight and the human race will be turned into ice-pops. Why, though, did history come adrift? Was it Sir Arthur Nightingale's dismal book about natural selection? Or was it the devastating response by an obscure country vicar called Charles Darwin, whose bestselling Theology of Species made it impossible to refute the divine design of living creatures? Either way, it's no easy task to change history, as the wizards discover to their cost. Can the God of Evolution come to humanity's aid and ensure Darwin writes a very different book? And who stopped him writing it in the first place?",,Paperback,9.78E+12,344 pages,3.94,3808,100,The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch,Fantasy|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440820882l/34515.jpg
Terry Pratchett|Ian Stewart|Jack Cohen,"The acclaimed Science of Discworld centred around an original Pratchett story about the Wizards of Discworld. In it they accidentally witnessed the creation and evolution of our universe, a plot which was interleaved with a Cohen & Stewart non-fiction narrative about Big Science. In The Science of Discworld II our authors join forces again to see just what happens when the wizards meddle with history in a battle against the elves for the future of humanity on Earth. London is replaced by a dozy Neanderthal village. The Renaissance is given a push. The role of fat women in art is developed. And one very famous playwright gets born and writes The Play. Weaving together a fast-paced Discworld novelette with cutting-edge scientific commentary on the evolution and development of the human mind, culture, language, art, and science, this is a book in which 'the hard science is as gripping as the fiction'.

Terry Pratchett|Ian Stewart|Jack Cohen,"When a wizardly experiment goes adrift, the wizards of Unseen University find themselves with a pocket universe on their hands: Roundworld, where neither magic nor common sense seems to stand a chance against logic. The Universe, of course, is our own. And Roundworld is Earth. As the wizards watch their accidental creation grow, we follow the story of our universe from the primal singularity of the Big Bang to the Internet and beyond. Through this original Terry Pratchett story (with intervening chapters from Cohen and Stewart) we discover how puny and insignificant individual lives are against a cosmic backdrop of creation and disaster. Yet, paradoxically, we see how the richness of a universe based on rules, has led to a complex world and at least one species that tried to get a grip of what was going on.",Revised Edition,Paperback,9.78E+12,416 pages,3.92,8551,296,The Science of Discworld,Fantasy|Fiction,https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426523507l/233674.jpg
